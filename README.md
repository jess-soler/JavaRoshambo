# JavaRoshambo

Rock, paper, scissors, also known as Roshambo, is a simple child's game that is frequently 
used to settle disputes. We are going to create a Roshambo game to play against the 
computer. 

In the game, a rock breaks the scissors, the scissors cut the paper, and the paper covers 
the rock. Each option is equally likely to prevail over another. If the players choose the 
same object a draw is declared, and the game is repeated until someone prevails.
